**Welcome to the development repository for AutoModSync!**

This project aims to eliminate the frustration of incompatible mod versions when joining custom Minecraft servers. By automatically synchronizing server-side mods to the client, AutoModSync promises a seamless and hassle-free experience for players and server administrators alike.

## üöß Current Development Status üöß

AutoModSync is currently in active development. Expect frequent updates, potential instability, and exciting new features as we progress!

**Key areas currently being worked on:**

* **Core Networking:** Establishing robust and secure IPv6 TCP communication between the client and server for mod list exchange and file transfer.
* **Mod List Management:** Implementing the logic for the server to accurately identify and manage its installed mods and their versions.
* **Client-Side Verification:** Developing the client-side system to compare local mods with the server's configuration.
* **ZIP Packaging & Transfer:** Building the server-side functionality to dynamically create ZIP archives of necessary mod files and efficiently transfer them to the client.
* **Automatic Installation:** Implementing the client-side logic to unpack and correctly place the received mod files.
* **User Interface (UI/UX):** Designing intuitive prompts and feedback mechanisms for the user during the synchronization process.

**Next Milestones:**

* [ ] Implement basic server-client handshake and mod list exchange.
* [ ] Develop the server-side ZIP creation logic for a single test mod.
* [ ] Implement client-side ZIP download and basic file placement.
* [ ] Design the initial user prompt for mod discrepancies.
